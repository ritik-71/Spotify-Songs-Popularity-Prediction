# 🎵 Spotify Songs Popularity Prediction

Welcome to the **Songs Popularity Prediction** project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the popularity of songs based on various features. The project explores the world of music data, utilizing features like danceability, energy, loudness, and more to determine what makes a song popular. 📊

## 🚀 Project Overview

In the music industry, understanding what makes a song popular can be invaluable for artists, producers, and marketers. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the popularity of songs. By analyzing different attributes of songs, the model provides insights into the factors that contribute to their popularity.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration

## 📂 Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains datasets used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to songs, such as:

- **Danceability**: How suitable a track is for dancing.
- **Energy**: The intensity and activity level of a track.
- **Length**: The time duration of the song.
- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
- **Valence**: Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.

These features, among others, are used to predict a song's popularity score.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves visualizing the relationships between various features and song popularity. By using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, we can gain insights into which features are most correlated with popularity.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The project implements several machine learning models to predict song popularity, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

The models are evaluated based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value.

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

The models are tested on a hold-out test set to assess their performance in predicting song popularity. The results are analyzed to determine the best-performing model based on various evaluation metrics.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- 🌐 Integrate a web-based UI for easier prediction of song popularity.
- 📚 Explore deep learning techniques for more accurate predictions.
- 📊 Perform further feature engineering and selection for model improvement.
